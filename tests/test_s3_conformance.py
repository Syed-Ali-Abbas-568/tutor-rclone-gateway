"""Live S3 conformance checks against a running rclone gateway.

Skipped unless ``RCLONEGW_TEST_ENDPOINT`` is set, so ``make test`` stays
offline. The generic-verb tests near the top mirror tutor-rustfs's
equivalent suite; everything below the "anonymous/private bucket split"
section has no tutor-rustfs equivalent at all, because those tests exist
specifically *because* this is a gateway (a translation layer in front of
a backend that was never designed to speak S3) rather than a native S3
engine. See EVALUATION.md for how these results were used, and
TESTING.rst for the full tiered procedure, including the manual,
secrets-gated real-Azure tier at the bottom of this file.

Run against a Tutor deployment in local (not dev) mode, so Caddy is
running and the public/private split is actually exercised::
